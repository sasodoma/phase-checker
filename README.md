# Phase checker
The goal of this project is creating a tool for telling apart phases in a 3-phase power grid.

## Goals:
### Hardware:
- Galvanically isolated mains input
- Battery powered so you can move between outlets
- Display

### Software:
- Some primitive PLL to eliminate drift
- Zeroing on the current phase
- Nice UI
